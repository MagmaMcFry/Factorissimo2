[technology-description]
factory-connection-type-fluid=Allows you to transport fluids through your factory building using pipes, underground pipes and storage tanks.\nHover over the connection arrow and press __CONTROL__factory-rotate__ to choose between input, output or balance mode. __CONTROL__factory-increase__ and __CONTROL__factory-decrease__ to change the update rate.
factory-connection-type-chest=Allows you to transport items through your factory building using chests.\nHover over the connection arrow and press __CONTROL__factory-rotate__ to choose between input, output or balance mode. __CONTROL__factory-increase__ and __CONTROL__factory-decrease__ to change the update rate.
factory-connection-type-circuit=Allows you to connect the circuit network to your factory building using the two special entities unlocked in this technology.\n__CONTROL__factory-increase__ and __CONTROL__factory-decrease__ to change the update rate.\n\n[Note: Circuit connections are pretty bad for your UPS. Don't use too many of them, and don't set the update rates higher than you need.]
factory-interior-upgrade-lights=Adds ceiling lights to all your factories.\nSolar panels will still not produce power inside factories.
factory-interior-upgrade-display=Adds an alt-view display to your factories. Put items in the overlay controllers inside your factory to determine what is shown on the outside.
factory-preview=Hover over your factory buildings and see what's inside! Hover over the factory power monitor and see what's outside! Hold a factory building in your hand to see what's inside!\n\n[Issues? Check out the ingame mod settings (Options -> Mods -> Per player)]
factory-requester-chest=Lost your picked-up factories somewhere in your logistic system? Use this chest to automatically request them back.
factory-recursion-t1=Allows you to nest factory buildings inside other, larger factory buildings.
factory-recursion-t2=Allows you to nest factory buildings inside other factory buildings of the same size.


[command-help-message]
give-lost-factory-buildings=Gives you all picked-up factory buildings in item form, except those already in your player inventory. Use the "destroyed" argument to also revive any destroyed factory buildings and give them to you. Using this command if the factory building items aren't actually gone may cause multiple items in your world to refer to the same factory building. These extra items will vanish with an "Invalid factory data!" message when placed.

Factorissimo2-better-recursion-2=Allows nesting larger factories in smaller ones once Recursion 2 is researched.
Factorissimo2-max-surfaces=Maximum number of surfaces Factorissimo2 should create for factory interiors. If you have more factory buildings than this number, Factorissimo2 will start reusing previous surfaces.
Factorissimo2-indestructible-buildings=Makes factory buildings immune to damage from outside.
Factorissimo2-allied-players-may-enter=Allows players to enter factory buildings of other allied forces.
Factorissimo2-enemy-players-may-enter=Allows players to enter factory buildings of enemy forces.
Factorissimo2-easy-research=Makes all Factorissimo2 research cost less.
Factorissimo2-easy-recipes=Makes all factory buildings cost less.
