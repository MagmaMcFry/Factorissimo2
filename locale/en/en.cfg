[technology-description]
factory-connection-type-fluid=Allows you to transport fluids through your factory building using pipes, underground pipes and storage tanks.\nRotate the connection indicator to choose between input, output or balance mode. Shift+rotate and Ctrl+rotate to change the update rate.\n\n[Note: Due to API limitations in 0.14, only certain types of pipe and tank can connect.]
factory-connection-type-chest=Allows you to transport items through your factory building using chests.\nRotate the connection indicator to choose between input, output or balance mode. Shift+rotate and Ctrl+rotate to change the update rate.
factory-connection-type-circuit=Allows you to connect the circuit network to your factory building using the two special entities unlocked in this technology.\nShift+rotate and Ctrl+rotate to change the update rate.\n\n[Note: Circuit connections are pretty bad for your UPS. Don't use too many of them, and don't set the update rates higher than you need.]
factory-interior-upgrade-lights=Adds ceiling lights to all your factories.\nSolar panels will still not produce power inside factories.
factory-interior-upgrade-display=Adds an alt-view display to your factories. Put items in the overlay controllers inside your factory to determine what is shown on the outside.
factory-requester-chest=Lost your picked-up factories somewhere in your logistic system? Use this chest to automatically request them back.
factory-recursion-t1=Allows you to nest factory buildings inside other, larger factory buildings.
factory-recursion-t2=Allows you to nest factory buildings inside other factory buildings of the same size.


[command-help-message]
give-lost-factory-buildings=Gives you all picked-up factory buildings in item form, except those already in your player inventory. Use the "destroyed" argument to also revive any destroyed factory buildings and give them to you. Using this command if the factory building items aren't actually gone may cause multiple items in your world to refer to the same factory building. These extra items will vanish with an "Invalid factory data!" message when placed.
