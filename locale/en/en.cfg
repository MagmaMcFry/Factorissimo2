[technology-description]
factory-connection-type-fluid=Allows you to transport fluids through your factory building using pipes, underground pipes and storage tanks.\nRotate the connection indicator to choose between input, output or balance mode. Shift+rotate and Ctrl+rotate to change the update rate.
factory-connection-type-chest=Allows you to transport items through your factory building using chests.\nRotate the connection indicator to choose between input, output or balance mode. Shift+rotate and Ctrl+rotate to change the update rate.
factory-connection-type-circuit=Allows you to connect the circuit network to your factory building using the two special entities unlocked in this technology.\nShift+rotate and Ctrl+rotate to change the update rate.\n\n[Note: Circuit connections are pretty bad for your UPS. Don't use too many of them, and don't set the update rates higher than you need.]
factory-interior-upgrade-lights=Adds ceiling lights to all your factories.\nSolar panels will still not produce power inside factories.
factory-interior-upgrade-display=Adds an alt-view display to your factories. Put items in the overlay controllers inside your factory to determine what is shown on the outside.
factory-preview=Hover over your factory buildings and see what's inside! Hover over the factory power monitor and see what's outside! Hold a factory building in your hand to see what's inside!\n\n[Issues? Check out the ingame mod settings (Options -> Mods -> Per player)]
factory-requester-chest=Lost your picked-up factories somewhere in your logistic system? Use this chest to automatically request them back.
factory-robotic-construction=Allows you to build factories using logistic and construction robots. Place a Factory Construction Requester Chest next to a factory, and it will build any blueprint-ghost buildings inside the factory using items from the logistic network. A Factory Construction Requester Chest will also record the contents of the factory next to it when added to a blueprint.
factory-recursion-t1=Allows you to nest factory buildings inside other, larger factory buildings.
factory-recursion-t2=Allows you to nest factory buildings inside other factory buildings of the same size.


[command-help-message]
give-lost-factory-buildings=Gives you all picked-up factory buildings in item form, except those already in your player inventory. Use the "destroyed" argument to also revive any destroyed factory buildings and give them to you. Using this command if the factory building items aren't actually gone may cause multiple items in your world to refer to the same factory building. These extra items will vanish with an "Invalid factory data!" message when placed.

[mod-setting-description]
Factorissimo2-free-recursion=Allows you to build recursive factory setups even without researching any of the Recursion technologies.
Factorissimo2-hide-recursion=Hides the Recursion 1 and 2 technologies, you will not be able to research them.
Factorissimo2-easy-research=Makes all Factorissimo2 research cost less.
Factorissimo2-preview-enabled=Enable the preview window that pops up when you hover over a factory building or its power monitor. Have you researched it yet?
Factorissimo2-preview-size=Set the size of the preview window.
Factorissimo2-preview-zoom=Set the zoom level of the preview window, in case it doesn't show the entire factory building. Use this when your GUI scale is lower than default.
